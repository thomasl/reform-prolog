This is the source code repository for Reform Prolog, a
recursion-parallel Prolog implementation. This release is not
maintained and we have not tried to build or run it in a long time --
it is provided mainly for historical interest. 

Development stopped in 1996.

We used SICStus Prolog during development, but Luther itself might
be powerful enough to recompile itself.
